README
    • Hi fellow ghostreader This is one of my first projects named PoseidonOne i named it that name like that guy Poseidon can reach really deep spots on the ocean as my project PoseidonOne. PoseidonOne is a line of commands that when it executed on the target it will make it unusable for an hour or half an hour but why im gonna make a targeted device shutdown completle and i MEANT IT 97% ,simply bc for my case my phone Steal so much time for me so insted of studying i ended up sending my felows reels for HOUURS and thats need to stop that's why i kinda created PoseidonOne and why i said kinda bc i used Ai to code it but BUT every idea is mine and im in charge and in control and if a devoloper happend to read this dont be afraid of ai taking ur job bc yes that's maybe right but u have to use it for u not against u and that's gonna give u a thing like a space gap to make your self more creative like me right now even idont have a big experience with javascript or shellscript.
    • Note: the Full-screen cinematic overlay with countdown is not tested yet and it can work without it but with no countdown or visual effects (poseidon.html).
